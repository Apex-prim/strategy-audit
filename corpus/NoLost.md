## Could not be measured

```
The config stoploss needs to be different from 0 to avoid problems with sell orders.
```

Declared timeframe: `1h`. This is a named cause, not a verdict on the strategy — see the note on buckets in [../BASELINE.md](../BASELINE.md).

## Checks

|---|---|---|
| look-ahead bias (freqtrade's own `lookahead-analysis`) | could not run | вывод не разобран |
