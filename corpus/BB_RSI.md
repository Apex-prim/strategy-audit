## Could not be measured

```
Timeframe needs to be set in either configuration or as cli argument `--timeframe 5m`
```

Declared timeframe: `none declared`. This is a named cause, not a verdict on the strategy — see the note on buckets in [../BASELINE.md](../BASELINE.md).

## Checks

| прогрев не объявлен | **found** | самый длинный индикатор 20 свечей, startup_candle_count не задан (по умолчанию 0) |
