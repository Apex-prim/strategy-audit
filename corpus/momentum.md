## Could not be measured

```
ImportError: Short strategies cannot run in spot markets. Please make sure that this is the correct strategy and that your trading mode configuration is correct
```

Declared timeframe: `5m`. This is a named cause, not a verdict on the strategy — see the note on buckets in [../BASELINE.md](../BASELINE.md).

## Checks

| check | result | detail |
|---|---|---|
| look-ahead bias (freqtrade's own `lookahead-analysis`) | could not run | Fatal exception! |
| indicator recursion (freqtrade's own `recursive-analysis`) | could not run | Fatal exception! |
| мёртвые настройки трейлинга | **found** | trailing_stop=False, но trailing_stop_positive=0.01 задан — читается как работающая защита |
